                Sam Morreale (they/them) is currently the Associate Producer at
                Soho Rep in NYC. An Artistic Producer, Director, and
                Facilitator, Sam approaches work with a dramaturgical lens
                rooted in anti-racism and anti-oppression. They are an avid
                supporter of art for social change and gravitate towards stories
                and people that uplift the lives of those who have been caught
                in the margins of society. Sam works to reckon with and readjust
                the theatrical cannon by re-centering QTBIPOC voices as a
                space-making advocate for these communities, particularly from
                within predominantly and historically white institutions. After
                receiving a BA from Wesleyan in Theater and Science Studies, Sam
                moved on to work with New York Stage and Film at Vassar College,
                Penumbra Theatre, Mixed Blood Theatre, Baltimore Center Stage,
                and the Theatre Communications Group. Sam understands their
                career path as one which continues to push institutions to
                spaces of deep listening in order to ensure that their actions
                align with social justice and the movement for progressive
                change.

                Upon graduation, Sam decided to actively pursue a career as a
                Producer in theater in an effort to make more space for theater
                artists of color, queer theater artists, and other storytellers
                who have not had historical access to make their art. They are
                really drawn to the power of storytelling to shift
                relationships. With the support of the tenacity given by lived
                experience, they began their career by saying yes to the spaces
                and communities that supported them. During the pandemic when
                work was scarce, Sam continued to build up their skills by
                launching a consulting practice as a guide for strategic and
                anti-racist planning in the arts. Outside of work, Sam is asking
                more and more what rest really looks like, who their community
                is, and discovering more about how they want to show up in this
                fraught world.

                  How did Questbridge help you while you were at Wesleyan?

                I wouldn't say QuestBridge helped me much at Wesleyan. It did
                help introduce us, however. It wasn't till being introduced to
                the QuestBridge program that I even thought I would be going to
                college, as it was a fantasy outside of my means. When
                QuestBridge helped to teach me the truth about the financial aid
                process at private institutions, I ended up Matched with
                Wesleyan and the rest is history. In my time, we didn't have
                much of a cohesive Chapter, but I always felt that I could turn
                to my fellow Questies in times of need as we collectively
                navigated this unknown space of privilege that most of us had
                not experienced before.

                I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I graduated from
                Wesleyan University in 2020 with a dual degree in both
                Psychology and Italian Studies. While at Wesleyan I developed a
                deep passion for prison reform and became involved with the
                Wesleyan Center for Prison Education program. I was also fairly
                involved with the admissions office becoming a Senior
                Interviewer during my senior year. I currently work as an
                Enterprise Account Manager at Bloomberg in NYC.

                As a low-income first-generation college student, college was
                always a goal but did not become a reality until I was matched
                with Wesleyan through the QuestBridge process. QuestBridge not
                only provided me with the education I strived to achieve but
                also supported me along the way with various mentors and
                assistance. Without QuestBridge I can honestly say I would not
                be in the position I am now, and for that, I am forever
                grateful!

                For a few years I worked for one of New York City's largest
                non-profits, BRC (led by Wesleyan alumni Muzzy Rosenblatt), to
                tackle issues of affordable housing, homelessness, COVID
                response and diversity, equity, and inclusion. I developed a
                skill set in project management and recently made the pivot to
                join the augmented-reality company Niantic, as a Product
                Marketing Manager. Now I work on the brand I loved as a child,
                managing marketing communications for Pokémon GO. In a world
                that often pushes you to disregard your inner-child, it's great
                knowing that my younger-self would be amazed to see where I am
                now.

                QuestBridge opened an entire path that would have been closed
                off to me otherwise. Without the National Match scholarship, I
                would not have been able to afford any sort of higher education,
                and the opportunities that I was privileged to have would have
                likewise been blocked off. My time at Wesleyan was a period of
                immense personal growth, where I met some of my closest friends
                and developed principles, values, and a world outlook that drive
                me to this day. By building some financial security, QuestBridge
                enabled me to actually focus on living and growing for the first
                time in my life without significant financial uncertainty
                hanging over my head. So many more deserve the kind of chance
                that I was given, and it is critical to improve accessibility
                for future generations.

                Hi! My name is Chris Jackson, I graduated from Wesleyan in 2020
                with a degree in Film Studies and English. I’m originally from
                Opelousas, LA and that’s where I’m currently living now. I heard
                about QuestBridge from my friend’s sister back in high school.
                She ended up using the program to get a scholarship to Rice,
                where I wanted to go for a bit, so I figured I’d give the
                program a shot. I went into the application process thinking I
                was going to study Film and Computer Science, so I picked
                schools based on that. I think Wesleyan was my third choice,
                behind USC and Rice.

                I obviously didn’t stick with Computer Science because I just
                hated it, but I feel like the route I took was so much more
                enriching than just forcing myself to learn for the sake of
                getting a job. Currently, I’m working in the Customer Success
                department of a company called Justworks. Not quite in line with
                my majors, but it’s given me a lot of stability in my post-grad
                life and has taught me a lot about my wants for the future. My
                goal is to become a Producer/Writer for films and TV and
                eventually own my own movie theater.

                I think what I most appreciated about QuestBridge during my time
                at Wes was the freedom it gave me to really explore and learn
                things that I don’t think I would have exposed myself to
                otherwise. I matched with Wes, so I paid basically nothing to
                attend. It was so freeing to not have the weight of worrying
                about paying back loans stopping me from enjoying college. I got
                to spend time doing tech for theater shows, serving on the WSA,
                joining the Alpha Delta Phi Society and doing so much more that
                made my time at Wes memorable.
