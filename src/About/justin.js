                        Questbridge is a sign of hope, perseverance, and
                        community. Our generation, especially those of
                        underrepresented minorities, sons and daughters of
                        first-generation immigrants, or those stuck in
                        generational poverty, look towards education as a
                        solution for financial security. We preserved through
                        the tough times, we put in the extra mile to get to
                        where we need to be, and we made sacrifices to be the
                        person we may or may not have envisioned. Questbridge
                        gave us a blessing and an opportunity to connect with
                        fellow students and to work together in pursuing a
                        financially-secure reality.

                        I love Wesleyan University. I think the college life
                        that I am currently experiencing here is amazing so far.
                        However, having met some QB scholars, to be truthful
                        with you, they seemed to feel disconnected, homesick, or
                        not welcomed at Wes; I had felt in those moments that we
                        were missing the inclusivity and connectedness among our
                        QB peers. My goal is to establish this place as a home
                        for all of the Questbridge scholars, both prospective,
                        incoming, and current, but to do that, we need
                        passionate voices that understand the wants and needs of
                        our peers. I believe I can represent that voice for the
                        QB class of 2023. I am dedicated, hopeful, and excited
                        to bring a new era to the QB chapter at Wesleyan and I
                        invite you to join us in this pursuit!

                        I had always silently laughed at the wisdom of adults
                        that kept telling us that "time flies by fast, enjoy it
                        while you can", but now that I am a rising senior, I
                        understand that wisdom all too well. College is a time
                        for discovery, learning, and independence. Take
                        advantage of the time here, work hard, and have fun!
